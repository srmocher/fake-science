Study Debunks "97% Consensus" Scare: Corals Prosper In Conditions of Warming
"Reef-building corals thrive within hot-acidified and deoxygenated waters".

That is the title of a recently published peer-reviewed scientific study.

And that title pretty much sums up the study findings that corals exposed to greater natural extremes prosper as well as those exposed to less harsh conditions.

Be it extreme water temperatures, extreme acidity, and/or extreme deoxygenation, corals exhibit a real world adaptability to survive and thrive that is in contrast to long-held dogma of laboratory researchers.

CO2science.org has an informative write-up of the study, including the adjacent charts and the below summation.

"Consequently, in light of all of the above, it would be wise for policy makers to give more consideration to the impacts of ocean acidification and warming as observed from natural environment analogs as opposed to more restrictive laboratory based analyses. And when such consideration is given, it appears that corals are well equipped to deal with future changes in their environment, be they naturally or anthropogenically induced."

Of course, popular doomsday prophets continue to badger policymakers and the public with frightful scenarios that human CO2 emissions will destroy, or already have destroyed, the planet's coral reefs. 

Yet, the growing volume of actual scientific research, such as this highlighted study, clearly refutes the falsity of such alarmist prophecies.

The below link list of coral reef articles, which examine recent research and empirical evidence refuting the popularized orthodox doom-dogma; and have been completely ignored by MSM fake-news operations since they prove the fear-mongering is nothing more than that.

"Scientists surprised that reef that survived the hotter holocene is already recovering from 2016 bleaching"
"How climate scientists mislead the world about the great barrier reef" 
"The End of the Ocean Acidification Scare for Corals"
"Scientists are stunned by corals as big as cars and thriving marine life at Bikini Atoll site where 23 atomic bombs were dropped"
"University researcher makes deep-sea coral reefs discovery in depths of the North-Pacific"
"The Future Fate of Coral Calcification in a CO2-Enriched World"
"Corals Found Deep in The Ocean Produce Their Own Sunlight to Survive" 
"Great Barrier Reef: 2016 Coral Cover Loss and Local Sea Level Fall"
"Coral Reef Sophistry"
"Coral Reefs, Temperature and Ocean pH"
These listed reviews of scientific research and analyses indisputably destroy the "97% consensus" alarmism that anti-science prophets of doom spew, including that of Al Gore, Cameron Diaz, Bill McKibben, Emma Watson, Obama, Leo DiCaprio, Chuck Schumer, Jessica Alba, Mark Ruffalo, Pharrell Williams, Michael Mann, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and many other celebrities.

In essence, these celebrity "experts" essentially repeat simple scare-mongering of global warming and climate change without the merits of any known empirical evidence research. Again, they actually spew anti-science.

Besides the selection of 2017 article titles noted above, there is an abundance of peer-reviewed studies stretching back over the years in regards to coral scientific research that debunks coral reef alarmism.

Additional 'C3' articles of peer-reviewed research.  "Reef-building corals thrive within hot-acidified and deoxygenated waters".
